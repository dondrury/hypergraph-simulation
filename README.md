# The Ruliad, a Simulation of Worlds

This is a project to partially simulated some of the worlds created by Stephen Wolfram's "The Ruliad". Each graph represents a simple space, and the structures that can form within it. I give the majority of credit to Stephen Wolfram, and his book, **A New Kind of Science**. We are taking the next step!

## The Secret I Realized

In his book, he approaches the Ruliad generatively, trying to locate individual transformations, applying them iteratively to build a world from scratch. I realized that the best approach is to ignore the individual transformations until a later date, and instead look at finding k-ordinal hypergraphs with k=3, since according to Wolfram, every hypergraph can be reduced to a 3-ordinal hypergraph and have the same structure.

## Is this a Grand Unified Theory of Physics ?

I beleive it **may** be, but the only way to find out is to analyse the spaces and the structures within them and see if they obey physical invariants. Before that can be done we must first produce all the 3-ordinal hypergraphs with 3 or less spacial dimensions, and stack them on top of each other (superposition) in order to see what sort of structures (light, bosons, fermions) emerge and how they interact with space and one another. Only then could we determine if they behave in the expected manner, with the symmetries predicted by the Standard Model. 

The problem is that the computational work to do such a thing is mind-boggling, and it cannot be performed deductively, by exploring all possible spaces. Instead, I am creating a "game" that is hardly more than a board game, to use the wonders of the human mind (which I beleive actually IS a quantum computer) to inductively discover spaces.

## The Game

Each graph can be viewed in "interactive" mode, where the user can "play" with it until it falls into 3-ordinal "compliance", and thus is proven to be a space that can extend infinitely in any of its "directions". Furthermore, one can induce "defects" in that graph, that have "locality". They would in some way relate to what we experience as a "particle", if I am correct. Have fun!
