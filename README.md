# The Ruliad, a Simulation of Worlds

This is a project to partially simulated some of the worlds created by Stephen Wolfram's "The Ruliad". Each graph represents a simple space, and the structures that can form within it. I give the majority of credit to Stephen Wolfram, and his book, *A New Kind of Science*. We are taking the next step!

## The Secret I Realized

In his book, he approaches the Ruliad generatively, trying to locate individual transformations, applying them iteratively to build a world from scratch. I realized that the best approach is to ignore the individual transformations until a later date, and instead look at finding k-ordinal hypergraphs with k=3, since according to Wolfram, every hypergraph can be reduced to a 3-ordinal hypergraph and have the same structure.

## Is this a Grand Unified Theory of Physics ?

I beleive it *may* be, but the only way to find out is to analyse the spaces and the structures within them and see if they obey physical invariants. Before that can be done we must first produce all the 3-ordinal hypergraphs with 3 or less spacial dimensions, and stack them on top of each other (superposition) in order to see what sort of structures (light, bosons, fermions) emerge and how they interact with space and one another. Only then could we determine if they behave in the expected manner, with the symmetries predicted by the Standard Model. 

The problem is that the computational work to do such a thing is mind-boggling, and it cannot be performed deductively, by exploring all possible spaces. Instead, I am creating a "game" that is hardly more than a board game, to use the wonders of the human mind (which I beleive actually IS a quantum computer) to inductively discover spaces.

## The Game

Each graph can be viewed in "interactive" mode, where the user can "play" with it until it falls into 3-ordinal "compliance", and thus is proven to be a space that can extend infinitely in any of its "directions". Furthermore, one can induce "defects" in that graph, that have "locality". They would in some way relate to what we experience as a "particle", if I am correct. Have fun!

## The Art

These are incredible structures, the most beautiful mathematic structures I've ever seen. They extend infinately, and are unimaginable shapes and forms. After many months of trying to display the hypergraphs on the screen, I found that the best way to represent them is in fact as the diagonal of a sparse matrix. We will also create sparse matrices, that wrap back upon themselves in order to determine the dimensionality and metrics of that space. This avoids the entire problem of rendering them as a web view or a picture. They live only in our minds, for now, but we can still determine their properties!

## The Rules

There is only one rule.

** Each Element relates to exactly three others. No more, no less **

For this one rule, uncountably many beatiful structures are formed. 

I have found, through playing with the interactive view that there is a sort of pattern to how one can move the "dots" around the matrix diagonal, however I cannot express them in words. I would love to work with somebody who can start to describe these patterns, I think they are key too understanding our physical reality, and are in some way related to Feynmann diagrams! Holy cow!

## My Goal for this Project

This is public and open source. I feel that this knowledge is so important that no person can or should claim authorship. Personally, I feel, like Nikola Tesla, that though I have put much personal effort into this way of thinking, that I have and continue to have help that I cannot fully explain. I encourage you to think of it that way as well, because Absolute Truth is discoverably only through humility, and not selfish motivations. If this in fact a Grand Unified Theory, all people shoud benefit, not just me, or you. Knowledge is, and should always be, free, to serve the benefit of mankind.
